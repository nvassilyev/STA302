### STA302H1: Methods of Data Analysis I (final Project)

We will be exploring various characteristics and factors of the neighborhoods situated in Toronto and the 
relationship between them and the volume of crime committed in each associated neighborhood. The 
analysis will be performed through multiple linear regression, where we will build a model which uses a 
number of explanatory variables in order to predict the outcome of a response variable. The purpose of 
this analysis will be to create a model that is descriptive and interpretable in the context of the study and 
simultaneously is able to make decent predictions on the crime volume of a neighbourhood. (intro of report)
